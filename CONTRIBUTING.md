# System Support

If you want to add support for a system, be sure to check the [API page](../../wiki/API).

The guide assumes you're contributing the code to another module or system. If you want to contribute to this project, you will still need to create a subclass, but you should add it to [LanguageProvider.js](/module/LanguageProvider.js) and its name to the import list on [api.js](module/api.js).

### System Specific Translations

Some translations are specific to a system (e.g. `COC7`, `SWADE`, and `WFRP4E`. When in doubt about its translation, check up with other translators of the system or the Babele module's translation.
